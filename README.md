# network-MI

In construction . . .

The file `functions.py` contains all functions to compute the network mutual information measures for graph similarity 
found in the manuscript arXiv.2405.xxxxx.
The folder `data` contains all data sets used in the manuscript: FAO product trades, APS scientific collaborations, 
and OpenFlights continental airport networks. The file `notebook.ipynb` goes through some of the results found in 
the manuscript, particularly the analysis over the FAO network.
