# Network mutual information

The file `functions.py` contains all functions to compute the network mutual information measures for graph similarity 
found in the manuscript [arXiv.2405.05177](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05177).
The folder `data` contains all data sets used in the manuscript: FAO product trades, APS scientific collaborations, 
and the OpenFlights continental airport networks. The file `notebook.ipynb` goes through some of the results found in 
the manuscript, particularly the analysis over the FAO network.
